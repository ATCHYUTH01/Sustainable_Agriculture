# Week 1 Progress Report ‚Äî Sustainable Agriculture (Soil Testing & Fertilizer Usage)

## üéØ Project Overview

This report summarizes the progress made during Week 1 of the Sustainable Agriculture Recommender project. The goal is to build an AI/ML pipeline that provides personalized fertilizer recommendations based on soil testing results and environmental conditions.

## ‚úÖ Week 1 Deliverables Completed

### 1. Project Scaffold Created
- **Clear folder structure** established with standard data science project layout
- **Documentation files** created:
  - `README.md` with project overview and quick start instructions
  - `project_goal.md` with concise project description and roadmap
  - `requirements.txt` with core dependencies (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, pytest, joblib)
  - `.gitignore` with appropriate exclusions for Python and data science projects
  - `LICENSE` file for project licensing

### 2. Synthetic Dataset Generation
- **500 soil samples** generated with realistic agricultural parameters
- **Data columns** include:
  - `sample_id`: Unique identifier for each sample
  - `pH`: Soil pH values (4.5-8.5 range)
  - `N`: Nitrogen content in mg/kg (10-200 range)
  - `P`: Phosphorus content in mg/kg (5-100 range)
  - `K`: Potassium content in mg/kg (50-300 range)
  - `organic_carbon`: Organic carbon percentage (0.5-5.0%)
  - `moisture`: Moisture content percentage (10-40%)
  - `crop`: Crop types (wheat, corn, soybeans, rice, cotton, vegetables, fruits, legumes)
- **File saved** as `data/raw/soil_samples_synthetic_week1.csv`
- **Reproducible** with fixed random seed (42)

### 3. Initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Statistical summary** generated using `df.describe()`
- **Data visualization** created:
  - Histograms for pH distribution with mean line
  - Histograms for Nitrogen (N) distribution with mean line
  - Plots saved to `results/ph_n_distributions_week1.png`
- **Data quality assessment** performed
- **Jupyter notebook** created: `notebooks/01_EDA_and_baseline.ipynb`

### 4. Baseline Rule-Based Recommender Implementation
- **`BaselineFertilizerRecommender` class** implemented in `src/recommender.py`
- **Crop-specific NPK targets** defined for:
  - Rice: N=120, P=60, K=60 kg/ha
  - Wheat: N=100, P=50, K=40 kg/ha
  - Maize: N=150, P=70, K=80 kg/ha
  - Cotton: N=80, P=40, K=50 kg/ha
  - Sugarcane: N=200, P=100, K=120 kg/ha
- **Key features**:
  - `recommend_for_row()` function returns NPK recommendations in kg/ha
  - pH warning system for values outside 5.5-7.5 range
  - NPK efficiency factors applied (N: 60%, P: 30%, K: 70%)
  - mg/kg to kg/ha conversion using soil bulk density
  - Comprehensive docstrings with safety warnings

### 5. Predictions Generated and Saved
- **First 50 samples** processed through baseline recommender
- **Results saved** to `results/predictions_week1.csv`
- **Output includes**:
  - Original soil parameters
  - NPK recommendations (N_need_kg_ha, P_need_kg_ha, K_need_kg_ha)
  - pH warnings for extreme values
  - Sample metadata (ID, crop type)

### 6. Unit Tests and CI/CD Pipeline
- **Unit tests** created in `tests/test_recommender.py`:
  - Test for rice sample with specific NPK and pH values
  - Verification that N_need_kg_ha >= 0
  - pH warning validation for normal range (6.5)
  - Additional tests for crop targets, pH thresholds, and unknown crops
- **GitHub Actions CI workflow** created at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
  - Runs on push and pull requests to main/master branches
  - Sets up Python 3.10 environment
  - Installs dependencies from requirements.txt
  - Runs pytest with verbose output
  - Tests data generation and recommender functionality
  - Includes dependency caching for faster builds

## üìä Key Metrics

- **Dataset size**: 500 synthetic soil samples
- **Test coverage**: Core recommender functionality tested
- **Code quality**: Unit tests passing, CI pipeline established
- **Documentation**: Complete project documentation and README
- **Reproducibility**: Fixed random seeds and clear instructions

## üîç Technical Insights

### Data Distribution
- pH values follow normal distribution around 6.5 (optimal for most crops)
- NPK levels vary realistically across different soil types
- Crop distribution reflects typical agricultural patterns

### Baseline Performance
- Rule-based system provides reasonable NPK recommendations
- pH warnings help identify soil conditions requiring attention
- Conversion factors account for real-world fertilizer efficiency

## üöÄ Next Steps: Week 2 & 3 Roadmap

### Week 2: Machine Learning Model Development
- **Train ML model** (RandomForest) on synthetic dataset
- **Feature engineering** for soil-crop-fertilizer relationships
- **Model evaluation** with cross-validation
- **Performance comparison** with baseline rule-based system
- **Hyperparameter tuning** for optimal recommendations

### Week 3: API Deployment
- **Build REST API** for fertilizer recommendations
- **Deploy model** to cloud platform
- **Create web interface** for user input
- **Integration testing** with real-world scenarios
- **Documentation** for API usage and deployment
